# Mine-sweeper

Mine-sweeper is a classic computer game that challenges players to uncover hidden mines on a grid-based game board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines.

This project aims to recreate the Mine-sweeper game with modern features and an intuitive user interface. The game provides an engaging and entertaining experience for players of all skill levels.

The game starts with a grid of covered squares, some of which contain hidden mines. Players must strategically uncover squares, using numerical clues provided on uncovered squares to determine the locations of nearby mines. By right-clicking on a square, players can mark potential mine locations. The game continues until all non-mine squares are uncovered or until a mine is triggered.
